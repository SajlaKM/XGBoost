# Financial Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements a financial fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a Kaggle dataset and applies data preprocessing, feature scaling, and an XGBoost classifier to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle. Ensure that the dataset contains transaction details with a target column (`isFraud`) indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.

## Features and Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - XGBoost Classifier for fraud detection.
  - Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrix heatmap for result interpretation.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection.git
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.
3. Modify the script to point to the dataset path.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

## Results
- Accuracy and classification metrics are displayed in the console.
- A confusion matrix visualization is generated.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Feature engineering for better fraud detection.
- Deploy as a web service for real-time fraud detection.
